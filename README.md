## Philippine National Railway (PNR) Tracking and Arrival Time Prediction
The PNR Tracking and Arrival Time Prediction project aims to create a user-friendly website with a back-end database to provide real-time tracking and accurate prediction of the arrival time of trains to each station. The system will have an admin system for authorized personnel to manage the database and update the website interface. With a role-based access control mechanism, the system will only allow authorized personnel to access specific functions and data.
