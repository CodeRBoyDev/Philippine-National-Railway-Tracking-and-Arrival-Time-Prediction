## Philippine National Railway (PNR) Tracking and Arrival Time Prediction
The PNR Tracking and Arrival Time Prediction project aims to create a user-friendly website with a back-end database to provide real-time tracking and accurate prediction of the arrival time of trains to each station. The system will have an admin system for authorized personnel to manage the database and update the website interface. With a role-based access control mechanism, the system will only allow authorized personnel to access specific functions and data. 

## Functional Requirements

Database Management:
The system should have a backend database that can store all the necessary information required for tracking and predicting the arrival time of trains. The database should be secure, scalable, and efficient, with the ability to manage large volumes of data.

User Access Control:
The system should have a role-based access control mechanism that can restrict user access to specific functions and data based on their roles and privileges. Access should only be granted to authorized personnel, and the system should be designed to prevent unauthorized access.

Web Interface:
The system should have a user-friendly website interface that can display the necessary information about the Philippine National Railway, such as business hours, ticketing price, route map of PNR, and most importantly, the time of arrival of trains to each station. The website should be responsive, accessible, and easy to navigate.

Real-Time Tracking:
The system should be able to track the location of each train in real-time and display it on the website interface. The system should also be able to provide real-time updates on the estimated arrival time of each train to its respective station.

Prediction Algorithm:
The system should be able to predict the arrival time of each train to its next station based on the distance of each station from one another and the speed of the train. The system should use an accurate prediction algorithm that can take into account various factors that can affect the arrival time, such as weather conditions and traffic.

Admin System:
The system should have an admin system where the administrator can input the time of departure of the train from the first station. The system should then automatically determine the expected arrival time of the train to the next station based on the distance of each station from one another and the speed of the train. The administrator should also be able to m
